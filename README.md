## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

File Encryption API is built as a custom connector to Microsoft Power Automate that allows 
Flow users to encrypt and decrypt their files stored on Microsoft OneDrive/SharePoint.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

This File Encryption API uses NodeJS. `node` and `npm` is required.
Guides on download and installing Node.js and `npm` can be found [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Make sure that `node` and `npm` is installed by running the following commands:
```
node -v
npm -v
```

### Installing

```
npm install
```

## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

```
npm run test
```

If everything is well, you should see all 12 test cases passed.

![`npm run test`](./docs/images/tests.png)

`server` contains integration tests. `utils` contains unit tests.

### And coding style tests

The project uses `eslint` but it is not yet strictly enforced.

## 🎈🚀 Usage and Deployment <a name="usage"></a>

To run the server for development and/or deployment, use
```
npm run server
```

`npm run server` will run `nodemon src/main/index.js`. 

`nodemon` facilitates live reloading of the server each time the server source code is changed.

The server will be running on port `8080` by default.
